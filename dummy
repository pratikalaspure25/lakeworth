Hi Jose — sharing details on Story: OOCRE Product Type (Loan – OPX) for your confirmation.

What I have done so far:

Added new Products under Product Type = OOCRE:

Purchase

Refinance

O/O RE Promo Rate

Created a Record-Triggered Flow (After Save on Opportunity)

In the Flow, when Product Type = OOCRE, I update:

LLC_BI_Product__c = {!$Record.CRM_Product__c}

LLC_BI_Product_Reference__c = {!$Record.CRM_Product__c}

Issue / Question for you:

LLC_BI_Product_Reference__c does not seem to be used in any Flow or Record Type, and it is a Managed field.

Even after mapping it in Flow, the value is not populating consistently.

👉 Can you please confirm:

Is it required to populate LLC_BI_Product_Reference__c, or should we only update LLC_BI_Product__c?

If it must be populated, is there any restriction on this field?
