let me know when you wan to talk about this, lets agree on how to do some basic analysis and document the findings. It's best to do that here withing BKU workspace
 
I’ll need a bit more time to review the details. I’ll let you know once I’ve had a chance to go through everything and am ready to discuss how we can proceed.
 
ok, sounds good. How about we talk about this tomorrow at 6:30 IST, that FPT call won't go long anyway
