Hi VK - I’m having an issue logging into the Copado org. I enter my username and password, and then the "Verify Your Identity" window shows up. But when I click the "Verify" button, nothing happens, and I can't proceed. Any idea what might be causing this?
Hi @Mariela Munoz Bolano,

Attached the screenshot for AC3 validation.

Verified that the four fields — Relationship, Status, Stage, and Primary Officer — are displaying correctly in Global Search for Product Packages.

Behavior aligns with the acceptance criteria. Moving the story to INT.

Hi @Mariela,
While updating the Global Search Layout for AC1, I noticed that there are already 7 fields configured.
Since Salesforce allows a maximum of 10 fields in a search layout, we can only add 3 out of the 4 new fields mentioned in the story.
Could you please confirm which of the 4 new fields are the most important to include?
Alternatively, we can remove one of the existing fields to accommodate all four, if that’s preferred.

Solution:
Create a custom Apex Trigger or Flow to restrict reassignment if the user's role is lower than the current owner’s role.
Flow can be used to create a validation that prevents users from reassigning cases where the role hierarchy is violated.

Create a Public Group for SSM Users
Go to Setup → Public Groups → New.
Label: SSM Group

Add all members listed:
Christopher Godfrey
Edgar Casiano
Janna Chinnery
JoAnn Robinson
Kristine Landini
Lenuta Uzun
Rosemary Hoadley
This allows you to use this group in sharing rules and Apex logic.

2. Case Object Sharing Settings
Navigate to Setup → Sharing Settings.
Set Case object to Private.
This ensures only owners and users with explicit sharing can view/edit.
Then create a Sharing Rule:
Type: Based on Criteria or Owner
Share with: Public Group → SSM Group
Access: Read/Write

✅ This ensures all SSM users can view and edit each other’s Cases.
