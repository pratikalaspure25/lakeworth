Solution:
Create a custom Apex Trigger or Flow to restrict reassignment if the user's role is lower than the current owner’s role.
Flow can be used to create a validation that prevents users from reassigning cases where the role hierarchy is violated.

Create a Public Group for SSM Users
Go to Setup → Public Groups → New.
Label: SSM Group

Add all members listed:
Christopher Godfrey
Edgar Casiano
Janna Chinnery
JoAnn Robinson
Kristine Landini
Lenuta Uzun
Rosemary Hoadley
This allows you to use this group in sharing rules and Apex logic.

2. Case Object Sharing Settings
Navigate to Setup → Sharing Settings.
Set Case object to Private.
This ensures only owners and users with explicit sharing can view/edit.
Then create a Sharing Rule:
Type: Based on Criteria or Owner
Share with: Public Group → SSM Group
Access: Read/Write

✅ This ensures all SSM users can view and edit each other’s Cases.
